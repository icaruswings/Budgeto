      "taskTitle": "Implement Email Notifications with Resend",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks such as setting up the Resend API client, creating the email template, implementing the job handler, adding error handling, and performing end-to-end testing.",
      "reasoning": "The task involves multiple integration points (Resend API, Convex) and requires implementing, testing, and handling errors in a real-time notification system, which increases its complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Define Convex Schema for Bills Table",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide this task into defining fields, configuring default values, setting up indexes, and validating the schema with sample data.",
      "reasoning": "The task is straightforward but requires schema design expertise and attention to detail to ensure proper indexing and validation."

      "taskTitle": "Implement CRUD Operations for Bills in Convex",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into implementing each mutation (addBill, updateBill, deleteBill), creating the listActiveBills query, and adding input validation and security checks.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing core backend operations with security and validation, making it moderately complex."
    },

      "taskId": 13,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Bill Management UI with Remix and Shadcn",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split into creating the bills route, implementing the loader function, designing the UI for listing bills, adding forms for bill management, and testing the UI responsiveness.",
      "reasoning": "The task involves frontend development with multiple frameworks (Remix, Shadcn) and integrating backend functionality, which adds complexity."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into defining the function signature, implementing frequency-based calculations, handling edge cases, and writing unit tests.",
      "reasoning": "The task is algorithmic in nature, requiring careful handling of date ranges and edge cases, but is limited to a single function."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide into fetching user settings, retrieving active bills, using the bill calculation logic, and updating the loader's return data.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating multiple data sources and calculations into an existing system, requiring attention to data flow and performance."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split into adding the UI section, implementing visual indicators, and handling edge cases like negative values.",
      "reasoning": "The task is primarily UI-focused and builds on existing data, making it simpler than others but still requiring a good user experience design."
